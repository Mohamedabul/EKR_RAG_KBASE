1. Key Points on the Intersection Between Employee and Professional Rights in Engineering
Employee and professional rights in engineering intersect where ethical obligations meet workplace policies. Employee rights ensure fair treatment, non-discrimination, and safety in the workplace, while professional rights involve maintaining intellectual autonomy and making independent professional judgments. Engineers are often required to balance corporate expectations with their duty to protect public welfare, sometimes leading to ethical challenges. Whistleblower protections are critical in safeguarding engineers who report unsafe or unethical practices.

2. Analysis of the Columbia Shuttle Disaster
The Columbia shuttle disaster can be analyzed as a failure rooted in engineering oversight, communication breakdowns, and organizational culture issues. The disaster occurred due to the insulation foam strike, a known risk that was not adequately addressed. This highlights the need for thorough risk management and safety protocols. Additionally, failures in decision-making processes, where engineers' concerns were ignored or downplayed, contributed to the tragedy, revealing gaps in organizational responsiveness to engineering input.

3. Intellectual Property Protection for Inventors and Creators
Intellectual property (IP) protection ensures that inventors and creators have exclusive rights over their inventions and works. This protection guards against unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution, allowing creators to commercialize their innovations and maintain control over their intellectual output. It also guarantees that inventors receive recognition and credit for their contributions, fostering a culture of innovation and creativity by providing a financial and legal framework to support inventors’ endeavors.

4. MNC Functioning with Respect to International Human Rights
Multinational corporations (MNCs) are expected to operate in compliance with international human rights standards regardless of the countries in which they conduct business. This includes ensuring fair labor practices, preventing exploitation such as child labor, and supporting sustainable business practices. MNCs must also ensure that their supply chains adhere to ethical standards and respect local customs and laws, as violations can lead to significant reputational damage and legal consequences.

5. Contributing Factor in the Three Mile Island Event
The Three Mile Island nuclear accident was primarily caused by human error, compounded by a lack of proper communication and response to technical failures. Operators misinterpreted signals from the malfunctioning plant, and inadequate training prevented them from taking the appropriate corrective measures. This incident underscores the critical role of effective training and crisis communication in ensuring safety in highly technical environments, as well as the need for robust procedures to handle emergencies.

6. Ethical Dilemma in Developing Weapons Technology
Engineers working in weapons technology face a profound ethical dilemma between advancing national security and contributing to the development of technologies that may lead to widespread violence and destruction. While weapons can serve as deterrents and protect nations, they also pose significant risks to human life and global stability. Engineers must carefully consider the moral implications of their work, balancing their professional duties with broader ethical concerns regarding peace and the potential consequences of their innovations.

7. Impact of Engineering Codes of Ethics on Professional Behavior
Engineering codes of ethics have a strong influence on shaping professional behavior by promoting accountability, honesty, and responsibility in engineers' work. These codes emphasize the importance of prioritizing public safety, maintaining professional competence, and avoiding conflicts of interest. By adhering to these ethical guidelines, engineers are encouraged to act as responsible stewards of technology, ensuring that their contributions benefit society while upholding the integrity of the profession.

8. Primary Purpose of Industrial Standards in Engineering
The primary purpose of industrial standards in engineering is to ensure safety, quality, and consistency across products and services. Standards provide clear guidelines that manufacturers follow to ensure that their products meet regulatory requirements and function properly in the marketplace. By adhering to these standards, manufacturers can increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve interoperability across industries. Additionally, compliance with standards boosts consumer confidence and facilitates broader market access.

9. Difference Between 'Eyewitness' and 'Expert Witness' in the Legal System
An eyewitness is an individual who provides testimony based on direct, personal observations of events relevant to a legal case. Their testimony is grounded in what they physically saw or experienced. In contrast, an expert witness is a professional with specialized knowledge in a particular field who provides expert opinions to help the court understand technical evidence. In legal cases involving engineering, an expert witness would explain complex technical matters in ways that non-experts, including jurors and judges, can understand.

10. Impact of Workplace Discrimination on an Engineer's Career Advancement
Workplace discrimination can severely hinder an engineer’s career advancement by limiting opportunities for promotions, recognition, and professional growth. Engineers facing discrimination may find themselves overlooked for key projects or leadership roles, which can lead to frustration and diminished job satisfaction.
