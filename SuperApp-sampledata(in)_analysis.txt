DATA QUALITY ANALYSIS REPORT
=========================

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
After analyzing the provided dataset, I have identified several data quality issues, inconsistencies, and potential problems. Here are the findings grouped by issue type:

**Missing Data:**

* [9, 'Software Owner'] - Missing value (count: 1)
* [10, 'IT Owner'] - Missing value (count: 1)
* [12, 'Existing Sub Domain'] - Missing value (count: 6)
* [15, 'Locations'] - Missing value (count: 3)
* [20, 'Regional'] - Missing value (count: 3)

**Data Type Issues:**

* [2, 'No.of.Users'] - Inconsistent data type (integer value expected, but string 'TBD' found in other rows)
* [5, 'Software Owner'] - Inconsistent data type (string value expected, but null value found)
* [10, 'IT Owner'] - Inconsistent data type (string value expected, but null value found)

**Data Quality:**

* [0, 'Supports'] - Inconsistent formatting (comma-separated values, but inconsistent spacing)
* [1, 'Supports'] - Inconsistent formatting (single value, but other rows have comma-separated values)
* [2, 'Supports'] - Inconsistent formatting (comma-separated values, but inconsistent spacing)
* [4, 'Locations'] - Inconsistent formatting (single value 'Worldwide', but other rows have comma-separated values)
* [10, 'Application Type'] - Inconsistent formatting (string value 'Custom Developed', but other rows have string 'Commercial Off-The-Shelf')

**Statistical Anomalies:**

* [2, 'No.of.Users'] - Outlier value (800, which is significantly lower than other values in the column)
* [4, 'No.of.Users'] - Outlier value (350, which is significantly lower than other values in the column)

**Business Logic Issues:**

* [0, 'Regional'] - Logical inconsistency (value 'Global' found, but location 'New York, London, Singapore' is not worldwide)
* [2, 'Regional'] - Logical inconsistency (value 'Global' found, but location 'Worldwide' is already global)
* [4, 'Regional'] - Logical inconsistency (value 'Global' found, but location 'Worldwide' is already global)
* [10, 'Application Type'] - Logical inconsistency (value 'Custom Developed' found, but software owner is 'Internal', which is inconsistent with custom development)

**Duplicate Records:**

* No duplicate records found.

**Encoding Issues:**

* No encoding issues found.

**Data Entry Errors:**

* [10, 'IT Owner'] - Data entry error (null value found, which is likely an error)
* [12, 'Existing Sub Domain'] - Data entry error (missing value found, which is likely an error)

Please note that these findings are based on the provided dataset and may not be exhaustive. Additional analysis may be necessary to identify all data quality issues.

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
### Data Quality Issues Report
The provided dataset contains several data quality issues that can impact the accuracy and reliability of analysis. Below are the detailed explanations of each issue, along with their potential impact, examples, and suggested solutions.

#### Missing Data
* **ISSUE LOCATION:** [9, 'Software Owner'], [10, 'IT Owner'], [12, 'Existing Sub Domain'], [15, 'Locations'], [20, 'Regional']
* **DESCRIPTION:** Missing values in various columns, which can lead to incomplete analysis and biased results.
* **IMPACT:** Incomplete data can affect the accuracy of statistical models, data visualization, and business decision-making.
* **EXAMPLE:** Row 9 has a missing value for 'Software Owner', which can make it difficult to determine the ownership of the software.
* **SOLUTION:** Impute missing values using mean, median, or mode for numerical columns, and use data imputation techniques such as regression imputation or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation for categorical columns.

#### Data Type Issues
* **ISSUE LOCATION:** [2, 'No.of.Users'], [5, 'Software Owner'], [10, 'IT Owner']
* **DESCRIPTION:** Inconsistent data types in columns, which can cause errors in data analysis and processing.
* **IMPACT:** Inconsistent data types can lead to errors in data aggregation, filtering, and sorting, and can also affect the accuracy of statistical models.
* **EXAMPLE:** Row 2 has a string value 'TBD' in the 'No.of.Users' column, which is expected to be an integer.
* **SOLUTION:** Convert inconsistent data types to the expected type, and use data validation techniques to ensure data consistency.

#### Data Quality
* **ISSUE LOCATION:** [0, 'Supports'], [1, 'Supports'], [2, 'Supports'], [4, 'Locations'], [10, 'Application Type']
* **DESCRIPTION:** Inconsistent formatting in columns, which can make data analysis and processing challenging.
* **IMPACT:** Inconsistent formatting can lead to errors in data aggregation, filtering, and sorting, and can also affect the accuracy of statistical models.
* **EXAMPLE:** Row 0 has comma-separated values in the 'Supports' column, but with inconsistent spacing.
* **SOLUTION:** Standardize formatting in columns using techniques such as data normalization, and use data validation techniques to ensure data consistency.

#### Statistical Anomalies
* **ISSUE LOCATION:** [2, 'No.of.Users'], [4, 'No.of.Users']
* **DESCRIPTION:** Outlier values in columns, which can affect the accuracy of statistical models and data analysis.
* **IMPACT:** Outlier values can lead to biased results and inaccurate predictions, and can also affect the reliability of statistical models.
* **EXAMPLE:** Row 2 has an outlier value of 800 in the 'No.of.Users' column, which is significantly lower than other values.
* **SOLUTION:** Use outlier detection techniques such as Z-score or Modified Z-score to identify and handle outlier values, and consider using robust statistical models that can handle outliers.

#### Business Logic Issues
* **ISSUE LOCATION:** [0, 'Regional'], [2, 'Regional'], [4, 'Regional'], [10, 'Application Type']
* **DESCRIPTION:** Logical inconsistencies in columns, which can affect the accuracy of business decisions and data analysis.
* **IMPACT:** Logical inconsistencies can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions, and can also affect the reliability of statistical models.
* **EXAMPLE:** Row 0 has a value of 'Global' in the 'Regional' column, but the location is 'New York, London, Singapore', which is not worldwide.
* **SOLUTION:** Use data validation techniques to ensure logical consistency, and consider using business rules to validate data.

#### Duplicate Records
* **ISSUE LOCATION:** None
* **DESCRIPTION:** No duplicate records found in the dataset.
* **IMPACT:** None
* **EXAMPLE:** None
* **SOLUTION:** None

#### Encoding Issues
* **ISSUE LOCATION:** None
* **DESCRIPTION:** No encoding issues found in the dataset.
* **IMPACT:** None
* **EXAMPLE:** None
* **SOLUTION:** None

#### Data Entry Errors
* **ISSUE LOCATION:** [10, 'IT Owner'], [12, 'Existing Sub Domain']
* **DESCRIPTION:** Data entry errors in columns, which can affect the accuracy of data analysis and business decisions.
* **IMPACT:** Data entry errors can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions, and can also affect the reliability of statistical models.
* **EXAMPLE:** Row 10 has a null value in the 'IT Owner' column, which is likely an error.
* **SOLUTION:** Use data validation techniques to ensure data accuracy, and consider using data entry validation rules to prevent errors.

### Critical Issues
The following issues are critical and require immediate attention:
* **Missing Data:** Missing values in various columns can affect the accuracy of statistical models and data analysis.
* **Data Type Issues:** Inconsistent data types in columns can cause errors in data analysis and processing.
* **Business Logic Issues:** Logical inconsistencies in columns can affect the accuracy of business decisions and data analysis.

These critical issues can be addressed by using data imputation techniques, data validation techniques, and business rules to validate data. Additionally, data entry validation rules can be used to prevent errors and ensure data accuracy.
